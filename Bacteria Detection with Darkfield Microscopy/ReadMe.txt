**About the bacteria**

Video demonstration of model trained with this dataset: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-J3L1Fvv60

Spirochaeta is a genus of bacteria classified within the phylum Spirochaetes. Included in this dataset are 366 darkfield microscopy images and manually annotated masks which can be used for classification and segmentation purposes. Detecting bacteria in blood could have a huge significance for research in both the medical and computer science field.
What is special about this dataset?

    It was gathered and annotated by students (hand-on experience)
    It has more than just one targeted class (blood cell and bacteria were annotated)
    It is highly imbalanced, so naive loss functions would work less properly
