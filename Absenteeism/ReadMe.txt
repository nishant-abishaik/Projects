**Important**

1. Absenteeim Preprocessing is the notebook wherein the different preprocessing methods are performed on the data.
2. Absenteeism Logistic Regression and its version with the Custom Scaler are separate files which have individual explanations.
3. Absenteeism Integration is a standalone version of the model which is modular and does not need the other files except for the preprocessed data.
4. Absenteeism_new_data in the Data folder is the test data that the model has not seen before and can thus be an accurate measure of performance.

Note: Change the directory where the data is loaded and the preprocessed data is stored accordingly. I have left out the line for saving the preprocessed_data file as a point.
